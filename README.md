# CS50
The solutions of the assignments of the Harvard's CS50 course.

## Problem sets
The solutions to the exercises are in the <a href="https://github.com/TiagoMaiaL/CS50/tree/master/problem-sets/">problem sets</a> folder.

## Books
I do already have some experience with programming, that's why I'm using <a href="https://www.amazon.com.br/Programming-Language-Brian-W-Kernighan/dp/0131103628">The C Programming Language</a> as the accompanying text book of choice, which has good exercises on each topic of the C language.

The solutions of the exercises of the books I'm using can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/TiagoMaiaL/CS50/tree/master/books/">books</a> folder.
